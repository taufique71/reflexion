title: Books I Have Read
description: List of books read by me recently

Reading books is my main work that I do when I pass some leisure time.
In the pre social media era I used to read a lot.
Then after opening a Facebook account in January 2009 this habit of mine was slowly replaced buy scrolling the useless newsfeed.
Not because I am a very social or socially active person.
But because just scrolling the newsfeed without doing anything is addictive enough.
I started a mission to consciously ditch all kinds of social media from October 2016 and tried to fill in those times with books.
Not to mention, I am not a voracious reader. 
I read a book taking quite a bit of time. 
When I come across something I like I read and re-read it. 
Contemplate on it for sometime and then move on.
Following is the list of books that I read recently.

Today is the last day of 2017.
So it's time to review my activities of 2017.
It's time to review how far I could achieve what I intended to achieve this year.  
<br/>

After ending last two years with milage of 3913 and 3871 kilometers respectively, this year my goal was to complete milage of at least 6000 kilometers.
Which means on average 500 kilometers per month.
Today at the last day of the year my milage is 6501 kilometers.
So, it means that I could reach the goal I set for myself this year.

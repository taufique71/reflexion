It's been a while I am riding an MTB but never before I have gone for a proper off-road ride.
There were several Josshila-Saturday events to the off-roads of Purbachal and Rupganj.
But my mud-phobia prevented me to join those.
As it's winter, thought there wouldn't be much mud at this time of the year.
So I took this chance.

The sun was just rising.
We found a thick layer of fog just above the ground as soon as we left the congested area of Dhaka and moved to the countyside.
Combining everything it was kind of a mystic environment at the start of the ride.

Dense fog around Purbachal area.

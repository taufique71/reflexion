It's been a while I am riding an MTB but never before I have gone for a proper off-road ride.
There were several Josshila-Saturday events to the off-roads of Purbachal and Rupganj.
But my mud-phobia prevented me to join those.
As it's winter, thought there wouldn't be much mud at this time of the year.
So I took this chance.  
<br/>

The sun was just rising.
We found a thick layer of fog just above the ground as soon as we left the congested area of Dhaka and moved to the countyside.
Combining everything it was kind of a mystic environment at the start of the ride.  
<br/>

Dense fog around Purbachal area.  
<br/>

After about eight kilometers along the Purbachal Express Highway, we paused for re-grouping and turned left to get into the off-road trails.  
<br/>

This is the place from where we started off-roads.  
<br/>

Here is another view.  
<br/>

It took no more than a kilometer to confront a muddy area after getting into the off-road trails.
Initially tried to ride past the muds but it was so deep that it became impossible to ride past.
So we stepped down from the saddle and pushed our bike to pass that specific area.
My nightmare came true.  
<br/>

Fellow riders are passing the muddy area.  
<br/>

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86956256@N03/38088957784/in/datetaken-public/" title="Josshila 195 - Purbachal Off-roads"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4560/38088957784_ac43f396ed_z.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Josshila 195 - Purbachal Off-roads"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
But the view was awesome.  
<br/>

Few meters later we got ourself into a dense bush.
Trail was invisible this time.
Most probably people reduced their activity in these trails.
We had to get down from the saddle again.  
<br/>

We had to pass the bush in this way.  
<br/>

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86956256@N03/27029514959/in/datetaken-public/" title="Josshila 195 - Purbachal Off-roads"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4580/27029514959_1140896c14_z.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Josshila 195 - Purbachal Off-roads"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Again, view was more beautiful after the bush.  
<br/>

Later we found our trail to be fenced off due to some road construction works.
But it couldn't stop us.  
<br/>

We crossed the barbed fence in this way.  
<br/>

Rest of the ride was more or less smooth.  
<br/>

From this small climb I had a Simba-like feel from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/">Lion King</a>.  
<br/>

View from top of that climb.

This drop troubled a few.  
<br/>

We got back and crossed the Purbachal Express Highway to enter the Ichapur area.
From Ichapur we returned through Bashundhara Residential Area.  
<br/>

We are entering Dhaka through Bashundhara Residential Area.  
<br/>

We had breakfast at Bismillah Hotel at Mohakhali and returned home. 
Overall, it was a great experience on the off-road trails and I liked it (except the mud-thing obviously).
Looking forward to have few more off-road rides this winter.

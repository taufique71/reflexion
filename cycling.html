To me bicycle is another definition of independence.
I have learned to ride bicycles at the age of 10. 
At that time I used to use my father's one for daily commute to school and teachers.
After moving to Dhaka in 2006 every now and then a question used to come to my mind - how would be the exprience to ride bicycles in this kind of busy streets?
Frankly it never seemed realistic to me.
But revolutions happen to make unrealistic situations realistic.
A community group named <a href="http://bdcyclists.com">BDCyclists</a> emerged and changed the streets of Dhaka city within few years.
A cycling ecosystem has grown.
Increasing numbers of cycles around me convinced me that may be this is time.
I bought a new bike with the second salary of my first job.
Since then, 2012, I have been using bicycle for commuting in these busier streets of Dhaka against all adverseries.
But my cycling activities were not limited to only commuting.
One day looking back I found out that I have completed quite a few century rides and even was part of a Guinness World Record also. 
Followings are my stories related to cycling -
